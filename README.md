# PKGBUILDs

## My AUR (Arch User Repository) PKGBUILDs

This repository hosts most of my adopted packages, recently adopted packages
may be missing.

You can find all my Packages by [searching the AUR itself][1].

Unfortunately some of the PKGBUILDs are not as goot as they could be, because
either the previous maintainer was missing something and I did not notice it
after adopting or packaging rules have changed after the creation of the
package and they have not been updated since. Also, because a PKGBUILD
basically is a bash4 shell script, I often use sed, grep, {}, case, if … fi and
hacks the like to get things done™.

However, if you feel like you have made one of my PKGBUILDs better, just
contact me:

 - message carstene1ns on [freenode irc][2]
 - send a [pull request][3] or [add an issue][4] on github
 - email arch carsten-teibes de (you have to fill in @ and . yourself)
 - use AUR comment section of the package

Please use a text pastebin like [pastie.org][5], if you changed more then 3
lines or want to include a full PKGBUILD when reaching me via email or AUR
Comments.
